    Components Needed:
    1. Grey container component stylized appropriately containing the following components
    2. Borrow a box button - please use import {Button} from "@material-ui/core", styled appropriately
    3. Join button - Disabled currently, but will lead to the registration flow eventually, also a Button

    2 and 3 don't need to be seperate component files, but can just be a modified Button component from 
    Material UI.

    Please put all the components in the "components/homePage/" folder.
